â€¢ The ability for user's to see their personal scores
â€¢ For users to see others' scores as well as their rank on the the global leaderboard
==========================================================
--JAVA CONCEPTS USED--

â€¢ Use of multiple classes (Main.java, Clicker.java, Stats.java)

â€¢ Use of an ArrayLists and an ArrayList of Objects (An arrayList of Objects was used for Stats Objects (Line 20 & Line 70))

â€¢ Use of File Input when writing player's stats to the scores.csv file (File Input was used when writing player's stats to the csv file (Line 53-56))

â€¢ Use of File Output when reading the file(Line 71-94) in order to output (file output was done when finding each players individual stats but also when the global leaderboard is shown)

â€¢ Searching is used when searching for player's individual stats (Line 99-106)

â€¢ Sorting is used when ranking player's scores by greatest to least and storing it in an ArrayList (Line 76 - 87)

â€¢ The use of JavaSwing to create a interactable GUI to improve user experince (learnt out of class - can be found in the Clicker.java class)

Comments have also been placed to further explain the code...
==========================================================
--KNOWN BUGS--
â€¢ A previously known bug that did occur was when the counter label and bitcoin label would overlap each other, but this was later fixed by changing the boundaries of the counter label

â€¢ Previously to make the log bitcoins and gen upgrade button to work, both actionlistener methods for each button was placed in one class causing errors, but later was solved when seprated into two different classes.
